I am a first year PhD student at UC San Diego advised by Prof. [Hadi Esmaeilzadeh](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hadi/?_ga=2.110419333.1876160750.1591468451-1462078445.1575245181).


The 21st century ushered many technological revolutions such as social networking sites and Internet-of-Things, which humans embraced efficiently. In recent years, the ability to harness computing power has significantly bolstered these technological revolutions. However, with the end of Dennard scaling and Moore's Law, microprocessor performance gains could not cater to the increasing computing demands due to advancements in applications such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics and Autonomous Driving Systems. However, I see this as a challenging research opportunity that opens a new era for innovations and is my primary motivation to pursue research. My research insterest broadly targets Computer Architecture, Machine Learning, and Security to build state-of-the-art intelligent and secure systems for the advancement of computing. My past research and industry experience has allowed me to explore a variety of interactions across the computer's hardware/software stack. I believe these experiences make me a suitable candidate to tackle diverse computing challenges.

Previously, I was a master's student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) where I worked with Prof. [Matt Sinclair](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sinclair/) on optimizing the memory heirarchy of GPUs for machine learning workloads. I have also worked on improving the performance of fine-grained synchronization primitives such as barriers and semaphores for GPUs.

I received my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [National Institute of Technology Sikkim], an institute of National Imporatance in India. I also have industry experience building next-generation microprocessors at [Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com/) and [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/).
