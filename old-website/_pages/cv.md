Projects
======
* xPU: Exploiting Device Level Parallelism to Accelerate Database Analytics - Spring 2020
* Implemented true sense reverse, tournament barriers and livelock free Semaphores in Heterosync, a Benchmark suite for fine grain
synchronization on tightly coupled GPGPUs - Spring 2019
* Analyzed coherence traffic bottlenecks in the GPU memory hierarchy for DNNs and RNNs using GEM5 APU. Working on mitigating
excessive atomics and data transposition in forward and backward propagation phases. Further, converted CUDA based YOLO to AMD’s HIP so as to run it in AMD’s GEM5 APU - Spring 2019
* Implemented adaptive cache bypassing technique in GPGPU-Sim Simulator to obtain 22% L1D cache miss rate improvement for
YOLO, a Deep Neural Network based object detection algorithm - Fall 2018
* Implementing BLAS APIs to perform Sparse/Dense Matrix Operations and improving their performance to match Intel PARDISO/MKL and LAPACK performance - Spring 2020  
* Design of Matrix multiplication, FFT and image blurring kernels using CUDA and OpenMP - Spring 2019
* Design and Synthesis of a controller for Segway Scooter based on gyro and accelerometer sensors - Fall 2018
* Replacing AES S-Box with Cellular Automata to improve the security - Fall 2015
* Design of Automatic Speech Recognizer using HTK Toolkit for Children Speech Recognization - Spring 2015
